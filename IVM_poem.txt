Science, oh science
you are very valuable
and you give us work
such that we will not twerk

We are not good dancers though
We eat too much coockie dough
Although I prefer cake
As well as Eminem over Drake

Eric Mortensen
science can help the earth
from our birth we should know its worth
yet we fail to listen
so as the hail glistens, we learn our lessons

Something is green and also blue
Is it sustainable or oh so cool
No this is not Instagram
It is the IVM

Camille Venier
THis is the IVM poem
Paralelled by absolutely no one
The better we learn the more we will earn
And then make the world more awesome

Marthe Wens
We believe in science
Or can one even believe in facts
if facts are just that - facts
We should trust science
